This blog post will be used to track my progress through the various exercises available in the [Reverse Engineering for Beginners](https://www.beginners.re/) book, by Dennis Yurichev. 

<details>
<summary>What is RE4B?</summary>
RE4B is a book written by Dennis Yurichev, designed to be an 'introduction' to reversing and assembly language (x86, ARM, MIPS). It goes over various topics such as assembly, disassemblers, compilers and decompilers, debuggers, and much more. In my novice opinion, this book is one of the best resources available for learning more about reverse engineering and assembly language. It is over 1000 pages and is packed full of code examples, walk throughs, and even exercises that give the opportunity apply the tactics taught from each chapter. 

I will not be posting solutions to the challenges I complete out of respect for the author's request, "please do not publish solutions on googleable forums, blogs, social networks, etc..", but I will update this page as I complete exercises to keep track of my progress.

I really enjoy discussing these types of challenges, even though some of them can be quite time-consuming. If you're reading this and would like to have a conversation, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Iâ€™d love to chat!

I am in the first chapter of this book as I mainly read it when I am not working on a CTF/course/school, but I wanted to create somewhere to track my progress through the book. Here are the challenges I have completed so far: 

Level 1:
- [Challenge 48](https://challenges.re/48/)
- [Challenge 49](https://challenges.re/49/)
